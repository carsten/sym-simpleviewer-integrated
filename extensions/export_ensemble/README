Export Ensemble
------------------------------------

Version: 1.9
Author: Alistair Kearney (alistair@symphony21.com)
Build Date: 28th July 2009
Requirements: Symphony 2.0.x, ZIP enabled (--enable-zip)

This extension will export your website, creating an installable version useful
for distribution. The resultant archive contains install.php, install.sql and 
workspace/install.sql files. This is how all official Symphony releases are 
created.

The ZIP module of PHP is utilised, and is memory efficient, allowing
for larger sites to be exported without the need for increasing PHP's 
memory limit.

Currently this extension adds a "Create" button to the preferences page. In the 
future it will instead have its own interface with options for including 
additional files and folders as well as excluding and other options.


[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the 'export_ensemble' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Export Ensemble", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.
